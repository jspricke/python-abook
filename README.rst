python-abook converts vcards (.vcf files) and writes them to your abook addressbook. 
It can also handle .vcf files containing multiple contacts. 
Additionally python-abook can convert your abook addressbook to .vcf format:

:: 

  # convert your address book to vcf (one vcf file contatining all contacts)

  $ abook2vcf --help
  $ abook2vcf ~/path/to/abook/addressbook ~/path/to/write/contacts.vcf

  # ommit the output file to print results to stdout

  $ abook2vcf ~/path/to/abook/addressbook


  # convert vcf contact/s and write them to your addressbook
  # NOTE: This will OVERWRITE your entire addressbook with the contents of input vcf

  $ vcf2abook --help
  $ vcf2abook ~/path/to/contact.vcf ~/path/to/abook/addressbook
